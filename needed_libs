Just a little list I use to personally get an overview of current
and planned dependencies:

* SDL2 			(DYNAMIC)												Current
* OpenAL Soft 	(DYNAMIC)												Current
* OpenGL 4.3 	(DYNAMIC, though should be on ~all systems)				Current
* GLEW			(DYNAMIC, though should be on ~all systems)				Current
* Lua 5.2		(STATIC, custom compiled without dlopen or readline)	Current
* stb_image		(~STATC, in source)										Planned
* stb_vorbis 	(~STATIC, in source)									Planned
* stb_truetype	(~STATIC, in source)									Planned
* Bullet physics(STATIC)												Planned
* RakNet/Enet	(STATIC, not decided entirely yet)						Planned

Making it a total of 2 dependencies of the system, assuming all works well:

* SDL2
* OpenAL soft

Both of which can be provided with the engine as .dll/.so
