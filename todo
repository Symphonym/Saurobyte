		* Networking (Some kind of component maybe)
CHECK	* Octree, or similar
		* Template function to send messages
CHECK	* Use smart ptrs
		* Sound class in Lua
		* Graphics, use new vertex class and transform component
CHECK	* Looping with streams
		* Offset with streams
CHECK	* Lua acessing components, transform specifically
DELETED	* Re-use sounds be swapping buffers and files intead of sources, use spare pool and delete if bigger than real pool
		* Global script running constantly, maybe
		* Lua play streams
		* Sound component
CHECK	* Optimize sound/stream reusage
		* Document function prototypes, cause I just installed DocBlockr, best shit 2014
		* Rewrite everything with new name and convert into library
		* Cleanup Game class and tidy up logging functionality
		* Write own math library to remove dependencies
		* Heap allocation might not be needed for messaging
		* Create serializable class that has switch for stream/lua and simply uses different functions when serializing data. Hide Lua dependencies and use lua environment class.
		* Entties can only be created from a Scene, the entitypool create function is private

		* Create YAML parser for config files
		* Create VideoDevice class for initializing and configuring OpenGL/GLEW
		* Create global settings interface where config files will store data
		* Create color class
		* Clean math classes and create more math stuff
		* FPS limit and delta time counting
		* Replace SDL stuff with C++11, chrono for timing, sleep and delta time and thread for threading (like audio)
